import pandas as pd

# Remove duplicated rows

# Drop columns with too much missing data
# More than 50% is good starting point
# df.drop(columns = ["DROPPED","COLUMN","LABELS"])

# Transform data to their correct data types

# Filling missing data with average for numerical data (imputation)

# A "null_value" for categorical data. Since missing data can also be a predictive factor

# Feature engineering

# Outlier removal

# Pickle and save
